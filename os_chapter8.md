### Address binding

- The process of associating program instructions and data to physical memory addresses

#### Compile time binding

if memory location is known at compile time, absolute code with absolute addresses can be generated

Must recompile code if starting location changes

#### Load time binding

if memory location is not known at compile time, relocatable code with relative address can be generated

Need onely reload though starting location changes

#### Execution time binding

binding is delayed until run time
whenever CPU generates the address, binding is checked

Need hardware support such as MMU for address mapping
Most OSs use this method

#### MMU - Memory Management Unit

- logical address
  - generated by the CPU
  - also referred to as virtual address
- Physical address
  - address seen by the memory unit

- MMU

  - hardware that maps logical addresses to physical address

- Simple MMU scheme

  - the value in the relocation register is added to every address generated by CPU

#### Dynamic Loading

- Routine is not loaded until it is called

- Better memory-space utilization
  - unused routine is never loaded
- useful when large amounts of error handling code are needed
  - Error does not occur frequently
- Load할 때마다 매번 동일한 address가 비어 있지 않기 때문에 dynamic linking이 필요함

#### Dynamic Linking

- Dynamic linking
  - linking is postponed until execution time
- Shared library
